## 🎯 Our Mission

Four Corners Group is on a mission to **break cycles** and **build futures**. We're fighting to decrease juvenile recidivism and end the school-to-prison pipeline by providing transformative youth programs across metro Atlanta.

**We believe every young person deserves a pathway to success.** ✨

## 📊 The Challenge We're Tackling

The numbers tell a sobering story:

- **430,000** juvenile arrests happen yearly
- **70%** recidivism rate among juveniles
- Too many youth trapped in cycles of re-offense and incarceration

**But here's the thing:** We're not just looking at statistics—we're changing stories. 💪
